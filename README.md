**1. Title:**

AI in Reliability Engineering and Applications (AIREA)

**2. Aims:**

Artificial intelligence (AI) makes a continuing major contribution to today’s global economy and future’s, it needs to address the challenge of producing more, while consuming less material, using less energy and creating less waste, which requires further investigation on its networking, increased flexibility, adapted structures, stronger links among research, innovation and industrial application. AI approaches are nature-inspired methods, which offer a wealth of ideas for complex problems solving. In the era of AI, AI is a way to program computers to learn from experience and improve their performance in a way that resembles how humans and animals learn tasks. As machine learning techniques become more common in everything from industrial applications, health care, finance to management.

Reliability is the important characteristics of products to ensure their operational safety. With the decreasing complexity of the structure and working conditions, reliability analysis and optimization have been challenging tasks. AI is now a reasonable selection for the complicated reliability analysis and optimization problems.

**3. Scope:**

The special issue includes theoretical, numerical, and experimental contributions that describe original research results, innovative concepts that address all aspects of Reliability Engineering and Applications. 

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

* methods for reliability and probabilistic safety assessment; 

* model and parameter uncertainties; 

* aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, sensitivity analysis, data collection and analysis; 

* engineering judgement and expert opinions; 

* human reliability; test and maintenance policies; 

* models for ageing and life extension; 

* systems analysis of the impact of earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, winds, floods, etc.; 

* codes, standards and safety criteria; 

* operator decision support systems; 

* software reliability; 

* methods and applications of automatic fault detection and diagnosis; 

* dynamic reliability; 

* design and evaluation of man machine systems and human interfaces; 

* design innovation for safety and reliability; 

* safety culture; 

* accident investigation and management.
